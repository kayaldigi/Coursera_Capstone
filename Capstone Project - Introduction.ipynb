So, the purpose of this project is to find some optimal locations for hospitals.\n\nParticularly, we are interested in locations of **Banglore, India** and we will focus on the areas with less or no hospitals. We are focussing on areas with **no hospitals** or having **less than 2 hospitals** within 1 km and **close to city center** as possible\n\nWe will use data analysis and clustering algorithm to generate the most optimal neighborhoods based on this criteria and suggest 5 neighbourhoods to the stakeholder as a result",
